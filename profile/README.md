**Hi there!**

I'm **Bhavyai**, a recent graduate (2022) from the University of Calgary, holding a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Software Engineering.

This GitHub organization is a curated collection of assignments, projects, midterms, and hackathons completed during my Master's program. Its purpose is twofold:

1. **Version Control**: This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my academic work, providing a transparent history of projects and assignments undertaken during my studies.

2. **Educational Resource**: Aspiring students can leverage this repository to gain insights into the structure and methodologies employed in various courses. However, it's crucial to note that while the content here can offer valuable learning opportunities, direct copying for assignments is discouraged. Instead, I encourage you to use it as a reference to enhance your understanding and problem-solving skills.

If you find these projects beneficial and wish to show your appreciation or support further development, consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zbhavyai) or sending me an Interac e-transfer at [zbhavyai@gmail.com](mailto:zbhavyai@gmail.com)! Your generosity helps fuel future endeavors and is greatly appreciated.
